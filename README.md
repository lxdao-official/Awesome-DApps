## 🚀 Why this list?

In the Ethereum ecosystem, open-source DApps are critical infrastructure—from wallets and protocols to creative tools and governance experiments.

This repo aims to highlight the most interesting, creative, and mission-aligned DApps—especially those with:

- Unique use cases or social impact
- Innovative onchain mechanics
- Strong ethos of decentralization and openness
